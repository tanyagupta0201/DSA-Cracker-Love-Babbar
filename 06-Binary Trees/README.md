# BINARY TREES

Binary Tree is a special data structure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.

## Important Terms
Following are the important terms with respect to tree :- 

```Path``` − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.

```Root``` − The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.

```Parent``` − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.

```Child``` − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.

```Leaf``` − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.

```Subtree``` − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.

```Visiting``` − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.

```Traversing``` − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.

```Levels``` − Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.

```Keys``` − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.
