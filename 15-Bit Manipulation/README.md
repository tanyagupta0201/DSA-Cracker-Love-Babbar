## BIT MANIPULATION
Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. Bit manipulation is something that has constant time complexity.It is an act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data that are shorter than a word.

Bit manipulation can obviate or reduce the need to loop over a data structure and can speed up coding as bit manipulations are processed in parallel.


Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include:
* Low-level device control
* Error detection and correction algorithms
* Data compression
* Encryption algorithms
* Optimization

# List of Bitwise operators


| Operator  | Name of operator                    | Usage        |
|:---------:|----------------------------|:----------------:|
| `&`       | Bitwise AND                |It takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.|
|  `│`      | Bitwise OR                 |It takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1.|
| `~`       | One’s complement / NOT     | It takes one number and inverts all bits of it.|
| `^`       | Bitwise XOR                | It takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different.|
| `<<`      | Left Shift                 | It takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.|
| `>>`      | Right Shift                | It takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.|
